        <p>
          If you are over 62 years young, love to ski but hate crowds this group
          is for you. We meet at the Summit Central Silver Fir Lodge on Tuesdays
          at 9:00 AM. Takashi Tsukamaki, Art Funamori, Ray Thomas and John
          Martinson will be your Group Leaders for three hours of great fun on
          skis. At noon we head in for lunch and camaraderie and are headed home
          by 1:00 PM or if you are so inclined back out on the mountain. This is
          a FREE event!
