          Private lessons are a wonderful way to brush off the cobwebs after
          some time off or a great way to become a better skier/ boarder and
          work on the areas that are important to you as a skier/ boarder
        </li>
        <li>
          Private lessons are NOT scheduled during any of our listed group

      <p>
        Once you have registered an interest for private lessons with the Mohan
        office you will be contacted at a later date to confirm all your
        requirements and take payment. We will also provide you with the details
        of your instructor and what to do at your first lesson.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        If you are a beginner skier/boarder, we advise not to book private
        lessons for the first two weeks in January due to the high number of
        skiers/boarders creating longer than normal chair lift lines. This can
        take away from your time on the slopes which we want to avoid. Should
        you wish to have lessons during this time we recommend choosing a
        weekday to avoid standing in line.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        If we experience severe weather on the mountain we suggest you always
        call your private lesson instructor or the Mohan office just before
        leaving for the mountains or while in route. As we operate in a winter
        environment, conditions can change quickly.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>weather forces a postponement, please contact the private instructor/ Mohan office for rescheduling.</p>
      <br />
      <p>Lift Tickets and equipment is NOT included. To avoid spending time with daily rentals, we suggest "Take Home Season Rentals”, see our Equipment page for more information.</p><br />
