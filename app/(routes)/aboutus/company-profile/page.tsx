      <p>
        Mohan Skiing & Boarding is one of the oldest, most well respected ski &
        snowboard schools in the country. In fact, we have been selected twice
        as one of the "Top 10" USA ski schools. <br />
        <br />
        Mohan operates as a Non-Profit corporation. Each year, we give away
        thousands of dollars in scholarships to students. More information about
        our scholarship program can be found <a href="/resources/maria-jose-scholarship" className="text-blue-600"> here</a>.
        <br />

        Our program was started in 1960 by Sally Strand, a Northshore District
        High School Science Teacher. It was her dream to create a ski school
        which allowed students in the district the opportunity to learn to snow
        ski and enjoy the mountain experience she loved. Now over 50 years
        later, we service the several school districts (Northshore, Seattle,
        Renton, Kent, Tahoma, Snoqualmie Valley and South Kitsap), as well as
        numerous private schools, Parks & Recreation programs, Churches and
        Senior Centers.
        <br />
        <br />
        Bringing about much of this change was John Mohan, who joined our
        program in 1966 (director from 1970 to 2000) and Rob Stimmel, who joined
        in 1967 (director from 2000 to his tragic death in 2015). You may learn
        more about our current team leaders <a href="/aboutus/todays-leadership" className="text-blue-600"> here</a>.
