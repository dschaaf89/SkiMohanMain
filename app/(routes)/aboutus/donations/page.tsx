        Mohan Skiing & Boarding is one of the oldest, most well respected ski &
        snowboard schools in the country. In fact, we have been selected twice
        as one of the "Top 10" USA ski schools. <br />
        <br />
        Mohan operates as a Non-Profit corporation. Each year, we give away
        thousands of dollars in scholarships to students. <br />
        <br />
        Our program was started in 1960 by Sally Strand, a Northshore District
        High School Science Teacher. It was her dream to create a ski school
        which allowed students in the district the opportunity to learn to snow
        ski and enjoy the mountain experience she loved. Now 50 years later, we
        service the six school districts (Northshore, Seattle, Renton, Kent,
        Tahoma, Snoqualmie Valley and South Kitsap), as well as 19 private
        schools, numerous Parks & Recreation programs, Churches and Senior
        Centers. <br />
        <br />
        Bringing about much of this change was John Mohan, who joined our
        program in 1966 (director from 1970 to 2000) and Rob Simmel, who joined
        in 1967 (Director 2000 too Present). You may learn more about our team
        leaders here. <br />
        <br />
        We invite you to consider registering for one of our School Programs or
        Lessons. Our Friendly, helpful, energetic staff makes your or your
        child's experience educational and memorable.
