    <p>Daily Lift Tickets are not included with your Mohan registration. You may pre-purchase them in advance on the Summits website. We recommend completing your order early as quantities are limited.  Buying a Season Pass saves you money if you use it just 6 or 7 times. Tickets or passes are available through <a href="https://summitatsnoqualmie.com/"className="text-blue-600">The Summit at Snoqualmie.</a>
    <br /><br />
The deadline for purchasing a student season pass is January 15th.  All season passes must be purchased from The Summit at Snoqualmie website.  After purchased The Summit will mail your season pass to the address in your guest account.  You will NOT be able to purchase your pass or tickets in person on the mountain.
<br /><br />
We highly recommend the LTD Season Pass, which is valid at any base area (we operate at Summit Central) except Alpental on the weekends.  For some students (Fridayâ€™s especially) the Twilight pass is a perfect option. Please be sure to read explanation of the passes before purchasing. It MUST be valid for the lesson day & time the student is registered for.</p>
<br />
<p><strong>Please be aware that The Summit is no longer taking cash.</strong>  They accept debit/credit cards and Summit digital gift cards.
