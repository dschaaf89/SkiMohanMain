      MOHAN SKIING & BOARDING STUDENT/PARTICIPANT ASSUMPTION OF RISK & LIABILITY RELEASE
      </h2>
      <p>
        Assumption of Risk and Liability Release: I/we recognize that snow
        sports activities are hazardous and could result in serious injury or
        death. I/we understand helmets are recommended, that providing/wearing
        an appropriate helmet is up to the participant and that exposure to
        injury or death may increase if I/we do NOT wear a helmet. I/we
        understand and agree that I/we may be riding the chairlifts with a
        student, instructor, a member of the public or I/we may be riding the
        lift alone. I/we have voluntarily made a choice to participate in this
        activity and accept the inherent risks. I/we accept my/our
        responsibility to be informed, behave prudently, and to read and abide
        by the Responsibility Code and all other posted behavior notices in
        these sports and in the ski area/mountain environment. I/We agree that
        I/we will not sue or make a claim against Mohan Skiing & Boarding, or
        any of its/their school districts or schools including, but not limited
        to, Seattle Public SD, Kent SD, Lake Washington SD, South Kitsap SD,

        Meridian School, the bus transportation company, Boyne USA Inc., or any
        of its/their owners, officers, agents, volunteers, or subsidiaries,
        including but not limited to, Ski Lifts Inc., Crystal Mountain, Inc.,
        and the U.S. Government or any of their/its employees, agents,
        contractors, subsidiaries, officers ("Released Parties") for any loss,
        injury or damage resulting from any cause including negligence, which
        arises out of my participation in any activity at the ski area,
        including but not limited to, use of the slopes, equipment, or any of
        the facilities or services on the premises. <br /><br />I/we agree to Release,
        Forever Discharge, Defend, Indemnify, and Hold Harmless Mohan Skiing &
        Boarding, or any of its/their school districts or schools including, but
        not limited to, Seattle Public SD, Kent SD, Lake Washington SD, South
        Kitsap SD, Northshore SD, Tahoma SD, Edmonds SD, Highline SD, , Renton

        Ridge ELC, Des Moines P & R, Renton P & R, Spruce Street School, The
        Meridian School, Highline SD the bus transportation company, Boyne USA
        Inc., or any of its/their owners, officers, agents, volunteers, or
        subsidiaries, including but not limited to, Ski Lifts Inc., Crystal
        Mountain, Inc., and the U.S. Government or any of their/its employees,
        agents, contractors, subsidiaries, officers ("Released Parties") of and
        from any and all liability, claims, liens, demands, actions and causes
        of action whatsoever arising out of or related to any loss, cost, damage
        or injury, including death, of any person or damage to property of any
        kind related in any way to the Program's operations or the errors or
        omissions of the Program, its agents, subcontractors, volunteers, or any
        other person directly or indirectly employed by them, or any of them,
        while engaged in any activity associated with this Agreement, whether
        contractually or otherwise.<br /><br /> Prior to December 1st of the current season,
        participants may request, in writing, a refund for their lessons &/or
        transportation. Refund requests for medical injury or condition
        preventing the student from participating may be submitted for review.
        Refund Requests are not guaranteed to be approved. Any approved refund
        request will have a $25 service charged. After November 30th of the
        current season lessons and busing are NOT REFUNDABLE. Financial
        commitments for insurance, staffing, administration, operations, and
        busing are made prior to the start of the program based upon the number
        of enrollees. However, if the program is not completed by April 30
        prorated refund checks will be issued. When processed there will be a
        $50 or 50%, whichever is greater, fee subtracted for each refund. In the
        case of a force majeure (act of unforeseen circumstances) hindering
        Mohan Skiing and Boarding from completing the current season NO refunds
        or credits will be owed. Funds will be used to pay our bills to keep us
        around for the following season and remaining funds will be used for
        scholarships the following season. <br /><br />Please note that postponing one or
        two times a season and automatically extending the program is typical
        due to weather or road conditions. Also, if there are less than three
        registered students for any class, we reserve the right to cancel the
        class or reduce the lesson time.<br /><br /> Participants will be expelled from this
        program without refund for: being willfully disobedient; possession of a
        weapon, use or sale of tobacco (if minor), alcohol (if minor), or
        controlled substances; vulgarity; discussing sexual topics; harassment;
        stealing; gambling; fighting; leaving the ski area (if minor); or for
        using non-approved transportation; or for returning to the bus past the
        set departure time. Additionally, if the participant's late arrival
        causes the bus to return late, the participant and/or parents will
        reimburse the program for all additional costs incurred (this is a
        minimum of $100 per hour, per bus delayed). Additionally I/we understand
        the ski area, at their discretion, may suspend my/our season pass,
        without refund, and ban me/us from the property for 12 months as well.<br /><br />
        This Release is binding as to any other persons, including family
        members, heirs and executors. If I am signing on behalf of a minor: I
        accept full responsibility for all medical expenses & claims related to
        the minor's participation in any activity as described above. <span className="font-bold italic">I also
        agree to the COVID-19 guidelines that state: Agreeing to allow staff to
        ride with student on the chair lifts despite the Summit’s outlined rules
        for health and safety during the pandemic and Failure to answer all
        screening questions accurately and subsequently testing positive
        nullifies all liability of Mohan Skiing & Boarding, a Non-Profit
        Organization 501(3)c.</span> I agree to RELEASE, HOLD HARMLESS, and INDEMNIFY
        the Released Parties from all claims brought by or on behalf of the
        minor.<br /><br /> My signature below means I/we, have carefully read, understand
        and approve this "Assumption of Risk & Liability Release" and agree it
        is binding upon me/us.
