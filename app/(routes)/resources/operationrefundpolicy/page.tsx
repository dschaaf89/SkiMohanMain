        Operation and Refund Policy
      </h1>
      <p>
        Prior to The End of the business day, 3pm, on November 30 of the current
        season, participants may request, in writing, a refund for their lessons
        and/or transportation. When processed there will be a $25 fee subtracted
        for each refund. After 3pm of November 30, participant’s lessons and/or
        transportation are NOT refundable since financial commitments for
        insurance, staffing, administration, operations, and busing is made
        prior to the start of the program based upon the number of enrollees.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>If the program is not completed by April 30, a prorated credit will be applied towards the following season.</p>
