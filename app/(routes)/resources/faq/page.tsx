        WHEN WILL I KNOW WHICH CLASS MY CHILD/CHILDREN HAVE BEEN ALLOCATED TO?

        HOW DO I PURCHASE A SEASON PASS?
      </h6>
      <p>
        If you plan to purchase a season pass, we highly recommend you complete
        that purchase as soon as possible. The Summit has limited inventory and
        will likely sell out relatively early. However, once you have completed
        your Mohan registration, you will be sent a link that will allow you to
        purchase a seasons pass up to January 15th. For more details, see our{" "}
        <a href="/resources/lifttickets" className="text-blue-600">
          Lift Tickets page.

      </p>
      <br />
      <h6 className="text-xl font-bold mb-6 ">
        I DON’T WANT TO PURCHASE A SEASONS PASS CAN I JUST BUY LIFT TICKETS FOR
        THE DAYS OF THE LESSONS?
      </h6>
      <p>
        Absolutely! If you know your child won’t be up at the mountain other
        than the days they have lessons with us it might be more cost effective
        to purchase day tickets. If you decide to do this, we recommend
        pre-purchasing them ahead of time (the summit has limited quantities and
        they do sell out) and your child can pick them up at the mountain.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h6 className="text-xl font-bold mb-6 ">
        DO I NEED TO BUY A SEASON PASS IF MY CHILD IS A BEGINNER AND WILL BE ON
        THE MAGIC CARPET?
      </h6>
      <p>
        Yes please, the Summit requires all skiers and boarders to have a
        seasons pass or lift ticket regardless of where they may be on the
        mountain.
      </p>

        WHERE CAN I RENT SKI EQUIPMENT FROM?
      </h6>
      <p>
        We have a list of recommended equipment suppliers on our website {" "}
        <a href="/resources/equipmentguide" className="text-blue-600">
          equipment guide.
        </a>{" "}
        If you are planning to rent equipment from the Summit we recommend going
        up to get fitted on a day before lessons start as fitting can take up to
        20 minutes or longer and you don’t want this to interfere with the first
        day of lessons.

        WHAT DO I NEED TO KNOW FOR MY CHILD’S/CHILDREN’S FIRST LESSON WITH
        MOHAN?
      </h6>
      <p>
        Be prepared for a little chaos on the first day but it’s all part of the
        fun we promise!
      </p>
      <br />
      <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mb-6 space-y-1">
        <li>
          Check we are operating before you leave the house – if you call our
          office there is a voice recording to tell you if we are open and
          operating that day.
        </li>
        <li>
          Know the class number you’ve been assigned so our greeting staff can
          direct you where you need to be.
        </li>
        <li>
          Know where we’re located - Summit Central (exit 53 off the I-90), if
          you are standing in the central plaza with the ticket offices and fire
          pit on your left and the statue of the bears in front on you, look up
          the hill and you will see the small hut with our logo on it our
          meeting area will be right around there.
        </li>
        <li>
          Check the roads – winter weather can be very unpredictable and changes
          hour to hour, we recommend checking WSDOT website to see what’s
          happening on the I-90.{" "}
        </li>
        <li>
          Be prepared – pack the car the night before you’d be surprised how
          many people arrive to class only to find they’ve forgotten their
          skis/board/boots/coat/goggles etc. It’s a good idea to pack extra
          water, snacks and blankets incase the pass closes at any point to or
          from the ski resort.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you have a question, ASK! We have supervisors dotted about
          everywhere that are willing to help you in anyway they can, if we
          don’t know the answer there will be someone who does.

        MY CHILD/CHILDREN HAVE NEVER SKIED/SNOWBOARDED BEFORE IS THERE ANYTHING
        WE CAN DO TO PREPARE THEM?
      </h6>
      <p>
        The best thing for you to do to prepare your child/children is to be as
        organized as you can, see the points above, it will make the experience
        so much easier for you all. If you are renting equipment we recommend
        getting fitted a few weeks before classes start so its ready for the
        first lesson, maybe go to the Summit ahead of the lessons so you know
        how to get there, where we’re located, maybe even have a little go on
        the skis/board!

        DO YOU OFFER ANY KIND OF DISCOUNT ON YOUR LESSONS?
      </h6>
      <p>
        No we do not, we are a non-profit organization and we’re offering the
        best price for our services. If you were interested in becoming an
        instructor for us one of the benefits is a discount on your
        child/children’s lessons.{" "}

        HOW LONG DO THE CLASSES RUN FOR?
      </h6>
      <p>
        Friday program – our Friday programs run for 6 weeks and classes are 2
        hours long. <br />
        <br />
        Saturday/Sunday program – our weekend programs run for 7 weeks and
        classes are 2 hours long.

        IF THERE IS SEVERE WEATHER HOW DO WE FIND OUT IF YOU ARE OPERATING?
      </h6>
      <p>
        There are two different ways to find out if we’re operating. The first
        way is to look on our website, on the homepage in the top righthand
        corner it has our operating status. The second way is to call our office
        number and listen to the recorded message regarding our operating
        status. If you are part of one of our school programs we will also
        notify your program coordinator who will also reach out to you too. It’s
        very important that you check we are operating before you set out to the
        mountain, winter weather can change hourly, its also worthwhile to look
        at the condition of the roads and check that the pass is open too.

        WHAT HAPPENS IF MOHAN POSTPONE A CLASS?
      </h6>
      <p>
        If we need to postpone a lesson during the season we will automatically
        reschedule the lesson to be the week following the last week of lessons,
        we will repeat this process until all the lessons have been completed.
        Please note the decision to postpone a lesson is NOT made lightly, we
        take in to consideration several factors from weather conditions on the
        mountain to the conditions on the roads traveling to and from the
        Summit. The safety of our students is our number one priority, and this
        includes travelling time too. We won't cancel a class unless we really
        think its nessessary.

      <br />
      <h6 className="text-xl font-bold mb-6 ">
        WHAT HAPPENS IF WE CAN’T MAKE IT FOR A CLASS DUE TO ILLNESS OR OTHER
        COMMITMENTS?
      </h6>
      <p>
        If you are unable to attend a lesson, please let the office know using
        one of the methods of contact listed below.

      <h6 className="text-xl font-bold mb-6 ">
        WHAT HAPPENS IF WE ARE LATE FOR OUR CLASS?
      </h6>
      <p>
        Mohan operates the following lateness policy - <br />
        <br />
        If you are 15 or more minutes late to your lesson Mohan reserves the
        right to refuse you entry to your class for that day. Absences that
        results in missing your class 2 or more consecutive weeks will result in
        you forfeiting the remaining classes without a refund. If you are late
        less than 15 minutes we will locate your class and take the student to
        their lesson.
        <br />
        <br /> We ask all our customers to appreciate that the area where we
        teach our classes is vast consisting of several different ski chairs and
        slopes, locating a class cannot only be time consuming but it also
        interrupts the lesson for the other students who have arrived on time.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h6 className="text-xl font-bold mb-6 ">
        I HAVE HEARD ABOUT MOHAN'S TEACHING PHILOSOPHY, WHAT IS THIS?
      </h6>
      <p>
        At Mohan it is our job to help parents understand the methods we use in
        our classes. Here is the our outlook in full - <br />
        <br />
        At Mohan our goal is to make every student feel safe and confident about
        themselves and their abilities through their experiences of success on
        the slopes.
        <br />
        <br />
        To enable us to do this our instructors have been trained in terrain
        specific teaching technique and use certain areas of the mountain
        (primarily Holiday, Gallery and Reggies) to teach more advanced
        techniques before transferring the class to more challenging terrain.
        Once the students can demonstrate the specific technique the class will
        progress to more challenging terrain. We want the students to be ready
        to do so safely and with control. Please keep in mind that throughout
        the course of the season your students may go back to easier terrain
        multiple times.
        <br />
        <br />
        This method of teaching has been used at Mohan for several years with
        positive results, enabling us to teach in a safe environment for our
        students and instructors alike. Therefore, it is important to remember
        the area of the mountain a lesson is taught does not always depict the
        ability level of the class.
        <br />
        <br />
        We believe learning is a life long journey that continues long after our
        lessons are over. Teaching our students how to ski safely, with care for
        themselves and others is imperative to our school.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h6 className="text-xl font-bold mb-6 ">
        CAN I WATCH MY CHILD’S/CHILDREN’S CLASS?
      </h6>
      <p>
        We really don’t recommend that you do, in our experience it’s very
        distracting for your son/daughter and can disrupt the lesson which is
        unfair for the other students in the class. If the lesson is taking
        place up on one of the slopes such as Holiday or Gallery you are not
        allowed to be "on foot" on these slopes as per the Summits rules, it is
        also very dangerous for you as well. If you are seen in these areas Ski
        Patrol or Summit staff will ask you to leave.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h6 className="text-xl font-bold mb-6 ">
        WHAT IF MY CHILD IS INJURED OR FEELING UNWELL DURING CLASS?
      </h6>
      <p>
        All our instructors are equipped with walkie talkies so if at any point
        there is an accident, or a student becomes ill they will radio a
        supervisor for assistance. We also have an emergency number on hand for
        all our students and will contact you on that number to inform you of
        the situation etc. It's important that when you register you provide the
        phone number your most likely to have on the mountain with you.

        WE WOULD LIKE TO CANCEL OUR LESSONS WHAT IS YOUR REFUND POLICY?
      </h6>
      <p>
        Prior to The End of the business day, 3pm, on November 30 of the current
        season, participants may request, in writing, a refund for their lessons
        and/or transportation. When processed there will be a $25 fee subtracted
        for each refund. After 3pm of November 30, participant’s lessons and/or
        transportation are NOT refundable since financial commitments for
        insurance, staffing, administration, operations, and busing is made
        prior to the start of the program based upon the number of enrollees.{" "}
        <br />
        <br />
        If the program is not completed by April 30., a prorated credit will be
        applied towards the following season.

        MY CHILD/CHILDREN HAVE TOLD ME THEY ARE BORED IN THEIR CLASS OR
        STRUGGLING TO KEEP UP WITH THEIR CLASS, HOW DO WE ADDRESS THIS?
      </h6>
      <p>
        The first step is to speak to your child’s instructor and let them know
        your son/daughter is not feeling challenged enough in class, they will
        then perform an assessment at the beginning of the class to see if your
        child should be moved up to the next level. The same procedure applies
        if your child is struggling to keep up. If your child is on one of our
        school programs please email the office with your concerns and we will
        ask the instructor to perform an assessment and feedback to us which in
        turn we can feedbacck to you.
